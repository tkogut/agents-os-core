Headless modelink

Run Antigravity CLI non-interactively to script agent tasks, integrate with CI pipelines, and capture machine-readable output.

Headless mode (also called print mode) sends a single prompt to the agent, streams or returns the response, and exits. Use it whenever you need the agent’s output in a program instead of a terminal UI.

Run a single promptlink

Pass a prompt with -p (or its aliases --print and --prompt) to run once and exit:

bash
content_copy
agy -p "In one sentence, what is a git rebase?"
text
content_copy
A git rebase rewrites the commit history by transplanting a sequence of commits onto a new base commit, imposing a strictly linear progression of changes that eliminates arbitrary merge artifacts.

The response goes to stdout. Diagnostics — errors, authentication prompts, progress, and permission notices — go to stderr. This split keeps the captured response clean:

bash
content_copy
# Capture only the model response; diagnostics still print to the terminal.
answer=$(agy -p "Name three popular version control systems, comma-separated.")

Note: Headless mode uses your cached credentials. Authenticate once with an interactive agy session first. In a non-interactive environment with no terminal (for example, CI), a run that is not already authenticated exits with an authentication required error instead of hanging.

Output formatslink

The --output-format flag controls the shape of stdout. It accepts three values:

Format	stdout shape	Use it for
text	The response text (default)	Human-readable output, quick scripts
json	One JSON object printed on completion	Capturing a result plus metadata
stream-json	Newline-delimited JSON (NDJSON) events	Monitoring progress, tools, and token usage
Textlink

The default. The response text goes straight to stdout with no wrapping:

bash
content_copy
agy -p "In one sentence, what does the command git bisect do?"
text
content_copy
Git bisect executes a binary search algorithm across a project's commit history to rapidly isolate the precise commit responsible for introducing a defect.
JSONlink

Set --output-format json to get a single JSON envelope after the run completes. The CLI emits it on one line; pipe through jq to pretty-print:

bash
content_copy
agy -p "In one sentence, what is a git rebase?" --output-format json | jq
json
content_copy
{
  "conversation_id": "055a398f-db14-4c5f-abbb-1bf03f8120a7",
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "response": "A git rebase rewrites the commit history by transplanting a sequence of commits onto a new base commit, imposing a strictly linear progression of changes that eliminates arbitrary merge artifacts.\n",
  "duration_seconds": 7.16,
  "num_turns": 1,
  "usage": {
    "input_tokens": 10415,
    "output_tokens": 657,
    "thinking_tokens": 616,
    "cache_read_tokens": 8113,
    "total_tokens": 11072
  }
}

The envelope contains these fields:

Field	Type	Description
conversation_id	string	ID of the conversation, for resuming later
status	string	Terminal status (see Status values)
response	string	The agent’s free-text response
error	string	Error message; present only on failure
duration_seconds	number	Wall-clock duration of the run
num_turns	number	Number of user turns in the conversation
structured_output	object	Parsed schema output; present only with --json-schema
json_schema	object	The schema that was enforced; present only with --json-schema
usage	object	Token counts: input_tokens, output_tokens, thinking_tokens, cache_read_tokens, total_tokens
Structured output with a schema

Pass --json-schema to constrain the answer to a schema. The parsed object appears in structured_output, and response holds the same payload serialized as a string:

bash
content_copy
agy -p "Parse the semantic version string v2.14.3 into an object with integer fields major, minor, and patch." \
  --output-format json \
  --json-schema '{"type":"object","properties":{"major":{"type":"integer"},"minor":{"type":"integer"},"patch":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["major","minor","patch"]}' | jq
json
content_copy
{
  "conversation_id": "4e502687-290c-4030-b908-5ed6c68fa5dc",
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "response": "{\"major\":2,\"minor\":14,\"patch\":3}\n",
  "duration_seconds": 4.45,
  "num_turns": 1,
  "structured_output": {
    "major": 2,
    "minor": 14,
    "patch": 3
  },
  "json_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "major": {
        "type": "integer"
      },
      "minor": {
        "type": "integer"
      },
      "patch": {
        "type": "integer"
      }
    },
    "required": [
      "major",
      "minor",
      "patch"
    ]
  },
  "usage": {
    "input_tokens": 10522,
    "output_tokens": 354,
    "thinking_tokens": 329,
    "cache_read_tokens": 8112,
    "total_tokens": 10876
  }
}

The flag accepts a schema string, a path to a .json schema file, or a primitive type name (string, number, integer, boolean). Read the parsed value from structured_output:

bash
content_copy
agy -p "Parse the semantic version string v2.14.3 into an object with integer fields major, minor, and patch." \
  --output-format json \
  --json-schema '{"type":"object","properties":{"major":{"type":"integer"},"minor":{"type":"integer"},"patch":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["major","minor","patch"]}' \
  | jq '.structured_output'
Streaming JSONlink

Set --output-format stream-json to emit one JSON object per line (NDJSON) as the run progresses. Use this format to observe tool calls and token usage in real time.

bash
content_copy
agy -p "In one sentence, what is a git rebase?" --output-format stream-json

The stream begins with one init event, followed by any number of step_update events, and ends with exactly one result event (the cwd and tools array are abbreviated below):

json
content_copy
{"event":"init","conversation_id":"c3b66b04-872b-4fbe-a3a4-058a026ef20a","init":{"cwd":"/home/user/project","tools":["ask_permission","run_command","write_to_file","..."],"permission_mode":"request-review"}}
{"event":"step_update","step_update":{"conversation_id":"c3b66b04-872b-4fbe-a3a4-058a026ef20a","step_index":0,"state":"DONE","step_type":"user_input"}}
{"event":"step_update","step_update":{"conversation_id":"c3b66b04-872b-4fbe-a3a4-058a026ef20a","step_index":3,"state":"DONE","step_type":"agent_response","text_delta":"Git rebase destructively rewrites a branch's commit history by systematically detaching its unique commits and sequentially reapplying them onto a new base commit.\n","duration_seconds":6.28,"usage":{"input_tokens":10302,"output_tokens":582,"thinking_tokens":551,"cache_read_tokens":8113,"total_tokens":10884}}}
{"event":"step_update","step_update":{"conversation_id":"c3b66b04-872b-4fbe-a3a4-058a026ef20a","step_index":4,"state":"DONE","step_type":"checkpoint","duration_seconds":0.53,"usage":{"input_tokens":116,"output_tokens":7,"thinking_tokens":0,"cache_read_tokens":0,"total_tokens":123}}}
{"event":"result","result":{"conversation_id":"c3b66b04-872b-4fbe-a3a4-058a026ef20a","status":"SUCCESS","response":"Git rebase destructively rewrites a branch's commit history by systematically detaching its unique commits and sequentially reapplying them onto a new base commit.\n","duration_seconds":6.88,"num_turns":1,"usage":{"input_tokens":10418,"output_tokens":589,"thinking_tokens":551,"cache_read_tokens":8113,"total_tokens":11007}}}

When the response streams in chunks, the agent_response step emits one or more ACTIVE events carrying partial text_delta fragments before its final DONE; short responses like this one arrive in a single DONE.

Every line is an event object whose event field names its type:

event	Payload key	Emitted
init	init	Once, at stream start
step_update	step_update	For each step transition or text delta
result	result	Once, at the end (same shape as json)

The init payload records the run configuration. model and agent appear only when set with --model or --agent; permission_mode is request-review by default (and always-proceed under --dangerously-skip-permissions):

Field	Type	Description
cwd	string	Working directory
tools	string[]	Names of all available tools
permission_mode	string	Effective permission mode
model	string	Model in use, when overridden
agent	string	Active agent, when overridden
json_schema	object	Enforced schema, when set with --json-schema

Each step_update payload describes one step. Observed step_type values include user_input, agent_response, tool, and checkpoint; state is ACTIVE while a step runs and DONE when it finishes:

Field	Type	Description
conversation_id	string	ID of the conversation
step_index	number	Zero-based index of the step
state	string	ACTIVE or DONE
step_type	string	Step category, for example agent_response or tool
tool_name	string	Canonical tool name, on tool steps
text_delta	string	Incremental response text
duration_seconds	number	Step duration, when known
usage	object	Per-step token usage, when known
tool_info	object	Tool invocation details (see below)
subagent_info	object	Subagent invocation details
Tool calls in the stream

On tool steps, tool_info carries the call and its result. This is a real tool step from a run that executed echo hello_headless_demo:

json
content_copy
{
  "event": "step_update",
  "step_update": {
    "conversation_id": "edb1c8c1-50ba-4f3f-87eb-412d0e9d47c3",
    "step_index": 4,
    "state": "DONE",
    "step_type": "tool",
    "tool_name": "run_command",
    "duration_seconds": 0.07,
    "tool_info": {
      "name": "run_command",
      "parameters": {
        "CommandLine": "echo hello_headless_demo"
      },
      "output": "hello_headless_demo\r\n"
    }
  }
}

tool_info holds name, parameters, output, and — when the tool fails — an error object with type and message. Steps that spawn subagents carry subagent_info instead, listing each subagent under subagents (with type_name, role, conversation_id, log_uri, and workspace_uris).

Structured output in the stream

With --json-schema, the schema applies to the terminal result event, which carries the same structured_output and json_schema fields as the json envelope.

Parse output with jqlink

stdout is machine-readable, so jq extracts exactly what you need.

Get the response text from a JSON run:

bash
content_copy
agy -p "Name three popular version control systems, comma-separated." --output-format json | jq -r '.response'
text
content_copy
Git, Subversion, Mercurial.

Concatenate streaming text as it arrives:

bash
content_copy
agy -p "Explain what a merge conflict is in two sentences." --output-format stream-json \
  | jq -j 'select(.event=="step_update") | .step_update.text_delta // empty'

Read token usage from the terminal result event:

bash
content_copy
agy -p "In one sentence, what is a git rebase?" --output-format stream-json \
  | jq 'select(.event=="result") | .result.usage'

Tip: Use jq -j (join output) when concatenating text_delta fragments so jq does not insert newlines between them.

Continue a conversationlink

Headless runs are stateless by default. Resume prior context with --continue (-c) for the most recent conversation, or --conversation with an ID from a previous run’s conversation_id:

bash
content_copy
# Continue the most recent conversation.
agy -p "Now explain your previous answer in more detail" --continue

# Resume a specific conversation by ID.
agy -p "Summarize what we discussed" --conversation 055a398f-db14-4c5f-abbb-1bf03f8120a7
Select a model, effort, or agentlink

List the available model slugs, then pin one for the run:

bash
content_copy
agy models
text
content_copy
gemini-3.6-flash-high     Gemini 3.6 Flash (High)
gemini-3.6-flash-medium   Gemini 3.6 Flash (Medium)
gemini-3.5-flash-medium   Gemini 3.5 Flash (Medium)
gemini-3.1-pro-high       Gemini 3.1 Pro (High)
claude-sonnet-4-6         Claude Sonnet 4.6 (Thinking)
...
bash
content_copy
# Pin a model by slug.
agy -p "Reverse the string antigravity." --model gemini-3.5-flash-medium

# Set reasoning effort (low, medium, or high).
agy -p "Outline a plan to add caching to this service." --effort high

# Select an agent (list them with `agy agents`).
agy -p "Review this function for edge cases." --agent <agent-name>

Unlike the interactive UI, headless mode does not silently fall back when --model names an unknown model. It exits non-zero with an ERROR status so a pinned pipeline fails loudly instead of running the wrong model.

Permissions in headless modelink

There is no interactive prompt in headless mode, so tools that would normally ask for confirmation are handled by policy.

By default, the CLI respects the permission mode in your settings. A tool that requires approval it cannot obtain is soft-denied: the run continues, exits 0, and prints a notice to stderr naming the tool and how to allow it. Reading and writing files inside your active workspace is auto-allowed; actions such as shell commands default to Ask and are soft-denied in headless mode unless you grant them.

Grant a tool ahead of time by adding an action(target) rule under permissions.allow in ~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json:

json
content_copy
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "command(git)",
      "command(npm run (build|lint|test))",
      "write_file(src/)"
    ]
  }
}

To auto-approve every tool for a run, pass --dangerously-skip-permissions:

bash
content_copy
agy -p "Run the test suite and report failures" --dangerously-skip-permissions

Warning: --dangerously-skip-permissions approves all tool calls, including file writes and command execution. Prefer scoped permissions.allow rules unless you fully trust the prompt and environment. See Permissions for the full rule syntax.

Handle exit codes and errorslink

A successful run exits 0. A run that fails to produce a response exits non-zero and writes the reason to stderr. In json and stream-json modes, the failure also appears in the status and error fields.

For example, pinning an unknown model exits 1 and returns an error envelope:

bash
content_copy
agy -p "hi" --model does-not-exist-model --output-format json; echo "exit=$?"
json
content_copy
{
  "conversation_id": "",
  "status": "ERROR",
  "response": "",
  "error": "invalid model selection (--model \"does-not-exist-model\" --effort \"\"): model does-not-exist-model is not recognized as a known model or custom model in settings\nAvailable models:\n  Gemini 3.6 Flash (High)\n  ...",
  "duration_seconds": 0,
  "num_turns": 0,
  "usage": {
    "input_tokens": 0,
    "output_tokens": 0,
    "thinking_tokens": 0,
    "cache_read_tokens": 0,
    "total_tokens": 0
  }
}
text
content_copy
exit=1

The status field reports the terminal state of the run:

Status	Meaning
SUCCESS	The run completed and produced a response
ERROR	The run ended with an error
CANCELED	The run was canceled
INTERRUPTED	The run was interrupted (for example, SIGINT)
INVALID	The run reached an invalid state
WAITING	The run ended while waiting on input
RUNNING	The run did not reach a terminal state

By default, a run waits up to five minutes for a response. Adjust the ceiling with --print-timeout:

bash
content_copy
agy -p "Summarize the design tradeoffs of optimistic locking." --print-timeout 15m
Flag referencelink
Flag	Default	Description
-p, --print, --prompt	—	Run a single prompt non-interactively and print the response
--output-format	text	Output format: text, json, or stream-json
--json-schema	—	Schema string or file path to enforce structured output
--model	—	Model slug for this run (see agy models)
--effort	—	Reasoning effort: low, medium, or high
--agent	—	Agent for this run (see agy agents)
--continue, -c	false	Continue the most recent conversation
--conversation	—	Resume a conversation by ID
--dangerously-skip-permissions	false	Auto-approve all tool permission requests
--print-timeout	5m	Maximum time to wait for a response
--sandbox	false	Run with terminal sandbox restrictions enabled
Example: run the agent in CIlink

Fail the job on error and save the response:

bash
content_copy
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

result=$(agy -p "Name three popular version control systems, comma-separated." \
  --output-format json \
  --print-timeout 10m)

status=$(echo "$result" | jq -r '.status')
if [[ "$status" != "SUCCESS" ]]; then
  echo "Agent run failed: $(echo "$result" | jq -r '.error')" >&2
  exit 1
fi

echo "$result" | jq -r '.response' > result.txt
