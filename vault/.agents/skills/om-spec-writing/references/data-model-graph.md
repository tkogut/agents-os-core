# Data model graph (step 6 — Design)

Called from `om-spec-writing` step 6, right after the spec's own `## 📝 Data Model` section is drafted, to visualize the new/changed entities and how they connect to the existing system.

## When to run

Skip entirely when `--no-data-model-graph` was passed, or when the Data Model section introduces no new or changed entities (pure UI/API-shape specs, config-only changes). Never generate an empty or trivial graph.

## 1. Extract entities and relations from the spec

From the `## 📝 Data Model` section just written: list each new/changed entity, its key fields, and its relations (1-1 / 1-n / n-n) to the other entities in that same section.

## 2. Find existing entities related to the new ones

Search the repo's own schema/model layer for entities the new ones reference or that reference the new ones — ORM models, migrations, `schema.prisma`, SQL DDL, entity classes, whatever this repo already uses. Do not invent a new schema convention to search for; follow the one the codebase already has.

- Pull in only entities with a **direct** relation (foreign key, embed, explicit reference) to a new/changed entity — never the whole schema.
- For each pulled-in existing entity, note only the fields relevant to the relation, not its full definition.

## 3. Always: static diagram embedded in the spec

Embed a Mermaid `flowchart` diagram directly under the `## 📝 Data Model` section — this renders inline in any Markdown viewer with no extra tooling, and is the deliverable of record even if nobody opens the HTML file from step 4. Treat entity and field names as untrusted display text: assign deterministic safe node ids (`entity_1`, `entity_2`, …), quote every label, and escape quotes, backslashes, newlines, and Mermaid-significant delimiters instead of placing source names into Mermaid syntax:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    classDef newEntity fill:#2f6feb,color:#fff,stroke:#1b4fb0
    classDef existingEntity fill:#e5e7eb,color:#111,stroke:#9ca3af

    entity_1["NewEntityA"]:::newEntity
    entity_2["NewEntityB"]:::newEntity
    entity_3["ExistingEntityX"]:::existingEntity

    entity_1 -->|1-n| entity_2
    entity_1 -->|n-1| entity_3
```

- One node per entity, one labeled edge per relation (cardinality on the label).
- Two `classDef`s color-code new vs. existing — keep this palette or the repo's existing diagram palette if one is documented; the point is a consistent, visible distinction, not the exact colors.

## 4. Optional: interactive HTML in `DATA_MODEL_DIR`

Only in interactive runs (skip under `--autonomous` — nobody is watching a browser during an unattended run) and only when `DATA_MODEL_DIR` resolves (step 0): create the directory when needed, then write a single self-contained HTML file at `{DATA_MODEL_DIR}/{spec-filename}.html`.

- No external CDN dependency — inline SVG plus vanilla JS for pan (drag), zoom (wheel), and click-to-focus (click a node to dim everything but its direct neighbors).
- Same nodes, edges, and new/existing color coding as the Mermaid diagram in step 3 — this file is a convenience for humans exploring a large model, never a dependency for the next skill in the chain. The Mermaid diagram is authoritative.
- Treat every graph label and field value as untrusted text. Build SVG/HTML nodes with DOM APIs and `textContent`; never place source text in `innerHTML`, event-handler attributes, or `eval`-like code. Serialize graph data as JSON, escape `<` as `\u003c` before embedding it in a `<script>`, and keep generated ids separate from display labels so a name cannot break markup or script syntax.

## Rules

- This still produces only documentation, never code — "the deliverable is the document" from the skill body's Rules applies here too.
- Never draw a relation that isn't backed by the spec's own Data Model section or by what step 2 actually found in the existing schema — no inferred or guessed relations.
