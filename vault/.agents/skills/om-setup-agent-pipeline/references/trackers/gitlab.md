# Tracker provider: GitLab

This file is the GitLab implementation of the tracker operations contract (see `TEMPLATE.md` for the contract itself). It is a **stand-alone** provider: GitLab owns the issues, merge requests, reviews, CI pipelines, and labels, so no companion descriptor is needed. Every operation runs against the GitLab REST API v4 through the `glab` CLI (`glab api`), on gitlab.com or a self-managed instance.

At runtime: `om-setup-agent-pipeline` copies this file into the repository at `.ai/trackers/gitlab.md` and sets `"tracker": "gitlab"`. When a skill says "tracker operation **get-pr**", execute the command documented under that operation heading in the repo's copy. The repo's copy is authoritative: teams extend or override any operation by editing it, and every skill picks the change up on its next run.

Skills say "PR" throughout; on GitLab a PR is a **merge request** (MR), and `{prNumber}` is the MR's project-scoped `iid`.

## Prerequisites

- [`glab`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli#installation) installed and authenticated (`glab auth login`, or `glab auth login --hostname <host>` for a self-managed instance; CI can export `GITLAB_TOKEN`), plus `jq`. Verify with **auth-check** before a batch run. Never print the token — do not run `glab auth status --show-token` in a skill.
- Every operation goes through `glab api` with REST v4 paths, not through convenience verbs (`glab mr update`, `glab issue edit`). The REST surface is stable across GitLab and `glab` versions, and each mutation touches only the fields it changes (`TEMPLATE.md`: mutate through the narrowest API surface). **auth-check** probes the `glab api` flags this file relies on (`--paginate`, `--input`, `--header`) instead of pinning a version.
- `glab` resolves the host and project from the checkout's git remote. All operations accept an optional `{repo}`: set `REPO` to the full project path (`group/subgroup/project`) to address another project on the same host; set `GITLAB_HOST` as well when that project lives on a different instance.
- Tier notes: multiple assignees, approval rules, and external status checks are GitLab Premium features. Everything here works on the Free tier and degrades as documented under **assign-issue / unassign-issue**, **review-pr**, and **get-required-checks**.

## Conventions

- Issues are written `#12`, merge requests `!12`; the two are **separate number spaces**. Human-facing text (PR bodies, comments) uses `!12` for an MR. The chaining reference lines skills emit keep their fixed machine shape — `PR: #<iid> (link: <MR URL>)` — so parsers are unchanged; the link disambiguates.
- An MR declares the issue it resolves with `Closes #12` (or `Fixes #12`, `Resolves #12`) in its description. GitLab closes the issue when the MR merges **into the project's default branch**; when the base branch is anything else, run **close-issue** explicitly after the merge.
- A **draft** MR is one whose title starts with `Draft:` (`[Draft]` and `(Draft)` are also recognized). **create-pr** adds the prefix, **mark-pr-ready** strips it, and **update-pr** preserves it while the MR is still a draft.
- Comments are GitLab **notes**. System notes (label changes, pushes) are always filtered out. Because issues and MRs have separate number spaces, a comment id is a **parent-qualified handle** — `issues/<iid>/<noteId>` or `merge_requests/<iid>/<noteId>` — emitted by **list-issue-comments**, **comment-issue**, and **comment-pr**, and accepted by **get-issue-comment**, **get-pr-comment**, **get-review-comment**, and **update-comment**. A note URL maps onto a handle directly: `…/-/issues/12#note_345` or `…/-/work_items/12#note_345` → `issues/12/345`, `…/-/merge_requests/12#note_345` → `merge_requests/12/345`. Recent GitLab versions (gitlab.com included) serve issues at `…/-/work_items/<iid>` and return that form as the issue `url`; it is the same issue iid.
- Operations that take "an issue or PR number" (**list-issue-comments**) need the kind: use `merge_requests` when the caller is working a PR, `issues` otherwise.
- Claim/lock signals on an issue or MR are: assignee = the automation user, the `in-progress` label, and a `🤖`-prefixed timestamped claim note. All three are readable back through **get-issue** / **get-pr**. The `ci-monitoring` label is **not** a claim signal — it marks finished, reported work whose CI-result follow-up is still owed, and never makes another skill back off.
- Review verdicts: GitLab's approval is native (`/approve`, `/unapprove`). GitLab has no REST verdict for "request changes" on every tier, so **review-pr** records each verdict as a note whose first line is a hidden marker — `<!-- review: APPROVED -->` or `<!-- review: CHANGES_REQUESTED -->` — and **get-pr** rebuilds `reviews` / `latestReviews` from those notes plus native approvals and reviewer states. Marker notes count only from users GitLab lists as the MR's reviewers or approvers (**review-pr** adds its user as a reviewer), so a commenter cannot forge a verdict, and an `APPROVED` marker drops out once its author's native approval is revoked (for example by "reset approvals on push"). `reviewDecision` is `CHANGES_REQUESTED` while a reviewer is in GitLab's "requested changes" state, any reviewer's latest verdict is `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, or the MR carries the `changes-requested` pipeline label; `APPROVED` when at least one approval satisfies the project's approval rules; `REVIEW_REQUIRED` otherwise.
- CI truth for an MR comes from its **head pipeline** (**get-pr-checks**). A job with `allow_failure: true` that fails is reported as `NEUTRAL` — GitLab itself does not block the merge on it.
- A read that fails is an error, never an empty answer: reads go through `gl_get` / `gl_list`, which fail when the request fails. Never pipe `glab api` straight into `jq` — without `pipefail` the pipeline reports `jq`'s status, so a failed search would read as "no matching PR" and a failed CI lookup as "no CI".
- Multi-line bodies are always sent from a file through `jq --rawfile` into `glab api --input -`, so formatting survives and nothing large touches a command line.
- Validate every externally-sourced value before interpolation: iids are numeric (`gl_iid`), `REPO` is a path (`gl_project`), comment handles match the handle shape (`gl_handle`).

## Label guards

Every label mutation goes through an existence guard so a missing label degrades to a logged skip instead of a failure, and `labels.enabled: false` in the config skips label operations entirely. The guards mutate with `add_labels` / `remove_labels` on the MR or issue itself, which changes only those labels. The project label list includes labels inherited from parent groups, so group-level labels satisfy the guard. GitLab separates label names with commas in these fields, so a label containing a comma is skipped.

```bash
# 0 = exists, 1 = missing, 2 = the label list could not be read (never treated as missing).
label_exists() {
  local labels
  labels=$(gl_list "projects/$(gl_project)/labels") || { echo "Could not read GitLab labels" >&2; return 2; }
  printf '%s' "$labels" | jq -e --arg l "$1" 'any(.[]; .name == $l)' >/dev/null
}

# $1 = add|remove, $2 = label, $3 = issues|merge_requests, $4 = iid.
gl_label() {
  gl_iid "$4" || return 1
  jq -n --arg k "$1_labels" --arg v "$2" '{($k): $v}' \
    | gl_write PUT "projects/$(gl_project)/$3/$4" >/dev/null
}

# PR (merge request) labels. $1 = label, $2 = MR iid.
apply_label() {
  if [ "$LABELS_ENABLED" != "true" ]; then return 0; fi
  case "$1" in *,*) echo "Skipping label '$1' (GitLab label fields are comma-separated)."; return 0 ;; esac
  label_exists "$1"
  case $? in
    0) gl_label add "$1" merge_requests "$2" ;;
    1) echo "Skipping label '$1' (not defined in this project or its groups). Create it with the create-label operation." ;;
    *) return 1 ;;
  esac
}

# Issue labels. $1 = label, $2 = issue iid.
apply_issue_label() {
  if [ "$LABELS_ENABLED" != "true" ]; then return 0; fi
  case "$1" in *,*) echo "Skipping label '$1' (GitLab label fields are comma-separated)."; return 0 ;; esac
  label_exists "$1"
  case $? in
    0) gl_label add "$1" issues "$2" ;;
    1) echo "Skipping label '$1' (not defined in this project or its groups). Create it with the create-label operation." ;;
    *) return 1 ;;
  esac
}

# Removal. Removing a label that is not applied is a no-op, not a failure.
remove_label() {
  if [ "$LABELS_ENABLED" != "true" ]; then return 0; fi
  gl_label remove "$1" merge_requests "$2"
}
remove_issue_label() {
  if [ "$LABELS_ENABLED" != "true" ]; then return 0; fi
  gl_label remove "$1" issues "$2"
}

# Pipeline labels are mutually exclusive: setting one removes the others first.
# Note the argument order, same as every descriptor: $1 = MR iid, $2 = label.
set_pipeline_label() {
  if [ "$LABELS_ENABLED" != "true" ]; then return 0; fi
  for label in $PIPELINE_LABELS; do
    [ "$label" = "$2" ] && continue
    remove_label "$label" "$1"
  done
  apply_label "$2" "$1"
}
```

Cross-project targets need no extra flags: every guard resolves the project through `gl_project`, so the existence check and the mutation always address the same project.

Read the labels back (**get-pr** / **get-issue**, field `labels`) whenever the label state gates a later decision — a skipped mutation is a normal outcome.

## Operations

### Identity and repository

#### auth-check
Verify the CLI, its API surface, and the credentials. → non-zero exit on any gap.
```bash
gitlab_tracker_auth_check() {
  command -v glab >/dev/null || { echo "glab CLI is not installed: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli#installation" >&2; return 1; }
  command -v jq >/dev/null || { echo "jq is required by the GitLab tracker descriptor" >&2; return 1; }
  glab --version
  glab auth status || return 1
  glab api --help | grep -Fq -- '--paginate' &&
    glab api --help | grep -Fq -- '--input' &&
    glab api --help | grep -Fq -- '--header' || {
    echo "Installed glab lacks the required 'glab api' surface (--paginate, --input, --header); upgrade glab." >&2
    return 1
  }
  glab api user >/dev/null || {
    echo "glab cannot reach the GitLab API for this checkout; check the git remote, GITLAB_HOST, and glab auth." >&2
    return 1
  }
}
gitlab_tracker_auth_check
```

#### current-user
→ the automation user's username.
```bash
CURRENT_USER=$(gl_get user -r '.username')
[ -n "$CURRENT_USER" ] && [ "$CURRENT_USER" != null ] || { echo "Could not resolve the GitLab automation user" >&2; exit 1; }
```

#### repo-info
→ full project path (`group/subgroup/project`), default branch, and web URL.
```bash
gl_get "projects/$(gl_project)" '{nameWithOwner: .path_with_namespace, defaultBranch: .default_branch, url: .web_url, visibility}'
REPO=$(gl_get "projects/$(gl_project)" -r '.path_with_namespace')
```

#### default-branch
→ the project's default branch (used when the config's `baseBranch` is `"auto"`).
```bash
BASE_BRANCH=$(gl_get "projects/$(gl_project)" 2>/dev/null -r '.default_branch // empty')
[ -z "$BASE_BRANCH" ] && BASE_BRANCH=$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@')
[ -z "$BASE_BRANCH" ] && BASE_BRANCH="main"
```

### Issues

#### get-issue
`{issueId}`, field list → issue data in the same shape as `github.md` (`state` is `OPEN`/`CLOSED`; comments carry note handles).
```bash
gl_issue_json() {
  local p t rc
  gl_iid "$1" || return 1
  p=$(gl_project) || return 1
  t=$(mktemp -d) || return 1
  glab api "projects/$p/issues/$1" > "$t/issue" || { rm -rf "$t"; return 1; }
  gl_list "projects/$p/issues/$1/notes?sort=asc" > "$t/notes" || { rm -rf "$t"; return 1; }
  jq -n --slurpfile i "$t/issue" --slurpfile n "$t/notes" '
    $i[0] as $x | {
      number: $x.iid, title: $x.title, body: ($x.description // ""),
      state: (if $x.state == "opened" then "OPEN" else "CLOSED" end),
      author: {login: $x.author.username}, url: $x.web_url,
      labels: [$x.labels[] | {name: .}], assignees: [($x.assignees // [])[] | {login: .username}],
      createdAt: $x.created_at, closedAt: $x.closed_at,
      comments: [$n[0][] | select(.system | not)
        | {id: "issues/\($x.iid)/\(.id)", author: {login: .author.username}, body, createdAt: .created_at, url: "\($x.web_url)#note_\(.id)"}]
    }'
  rc=$?; rm -rf "$t"; return "$rc"
}
gl_issue_json {issueId}
```

#### search-issues
Query and state (`opened`, `closed`, or `all`) → matching issues. Searches title and description.
```bash
Q=$(printf '%s' "<query>" | jq -sRr @uri)
STATE=opened   # opened | closed | all
gl_get "projects/$(gl_project)/issues?state=${STATE}&in=title,description&search=${Q}&per_page=100" \
  '[.[] | {number: .iid, title, url: .web_url, state: (if .state == "opened" then "OPEN" else "CLOSED" end)}]'
```

#### create-issue
Title, body file, assignee, labels → created issue URL. The issue is created before assignment because GitLab Free does not accept the create endpoint's Premium-only `assignee_ids`; the shared update helper handles the single-assignee response. Labels are also applied **after** creation through the guard: GitLab silently creates any unknown label passed at creation time, which would bypass the taxonomy.
```bash
ISSUE_ASSIGNEE="<username>"
ISSUE=$(jq -n --arg t "<title>" --rawfile d <body-file> '{title: $t, description: $d}' \
  | gl_write POST "projects/$(gl_project)/issues")
ISSUE_ID=$(printf '%s' "$ISSUE" | jq -er '.iid') || exit 1
ISSUE_URL=$(printf '%s' "$ISSUE" | jq -er '.web_url') || exit 1
[ -z "$ISSUE_ASSIGNEE" ] || gl_assign issues "$ISSUE_ID" add "$ISSUE_ASSIGNEE" ||
  echo "Created issue $ISSUE_ID, but could not assign $ISSUE_ASSIGNEE; report the assignment failure to the user." >&2
for label in <labels>; do apply_issue_label "$label" "$ISSUE_ID"; done
```

#### close-issue
`{issueId}`, reason, closing comment. GitLab has no close reason; state it in the comment (`completed`, `not planned`, `duplicate of #N`).
```bash
gl_iid {issueId} || exit 1
gl_note issues {issueId} <comment-file> >/dev/null || exit 1
jq -n '{state_event: "close"}' | gl_write PUT "projects/$(gl_project)/issues/{issueId}" | jq -e '.state == "closed"' >/dev/null
```

#### comment-issue
`{issueId}`, body file → the new note's handle.
```bash
gl_iid {issueId} || exit 1
gl_note issues {issueId} <body-file>
```

#### update-issue
`{issueId}`, new title and/or body. Edits only the issue's own fields; pass only what changed.
```bash
gl_iid {issueId} || exit 1
jq -n --arg t "<title>" '{title: $t}' | gl_write PUT "projects/$(gl_project)/issues/{issueId}" >/dev/null
jq -n --rawfile d <body-file> '{description: $d}' | gl_write PUT "projects/$(gl_project)/issues/{issueId}" >/dev/null
```

#### assign-issue / unassign-issue
`{issueId}`, username. GitLab replaces the whole assignee list, so read it, add or remove the one user, and write it back. On the Free tier an issue holds one assignee: when another user already holds the slot, the add does not take effect — the read-back reports it, and the claim then rests on the `in-progress` label and the claim note.
```bash
gl_assign issues {issueId} add <username>
gl_assign issues {issueId} remove <username>
```

#### label-issue / unlabel-issue
Always through the guards: `apply_issue_label "<label>" {issueId}` / `remove_issue_label "<label>" {issueId}`.

#### get-issue-comment
Comment handle → body, author, URL.
```bash
gl_get_comment() {
  local p web
  gl_handle "$1" || return 1
  p=$(gl_project) || return 1
  web=$(gl_get "projects/$p/${1%/*}" -r '.web_url') || return 1
  gl_get "projects/$p/${1%/*}/notes/${1##*/}" --arg u "$web#note_${1##*/}" '{body, user: .author.username, url: $u}'
}
gl_get_comment {commentHandle}
```

#### list-issue-comments
Kind (`issues`, or `merge_requests` when the caller is working a PR) and iid → conversation comments, oldest first, with their handles. System notes and inline diff notes are excluded (inline notes come from **list-review-comments**).
```bash
gl_list_comments() {
  gl_iid "$2" || return 1
  gl_list_jq "projects/$(gl_project)/$1/$2/notes?sort=asc" \
    --arg k "$1/$2" '[.[] | select((.system | not) and .type != "DiffNote") | {id: "\($k)/\(.id)", user: .author.username, body, createdAt: .created_at}]'
}
gl_list_comments issues {issueId}
gl_list_comments merge_requests {prNumber}
```

#### update-comment
Comment handle, new body file → the note rewritten in place (issue and MR notes alike). This is how marker-idempotent comments are updated on re-runs: find the `🤖 …` marker via **list-issue-comments**, then update that handle.
```bash
COMMENT_HANDLE={commentHandle}
gl_handle "$COMMENT_HANDLE" || exit 1
jq -n --rawfile b <body-file> '{body: $b}' \
  | gl_write PUT "projects/$(gl_project)/${COMMENT_HANDLE%/*}/notes/${COMMENT_HANDLE##*/}" >/dev/null
```

### Pull requests

#### get-pr
`{prNumber}` (MR iid) → PR data in the field set `github.md` documents, serialized the same way: `state` `OPEN`/`CLOSED`/`MERGED`, review states `APPROVED`/`CHANGES_REQUESTED`, ISO-8601 timestamps. Select the fields the calling skill names from the object.
```bash
PR_JSON=$(gl_pr_json {prNumber}) || exit 1
printf '%s' "$PR_JSON" | jq '{number, title, url, state, isDraft, labels, reviewDecision}'   # select the requested fields
```
Mapping notes: `mergeable` / `mergeStateStatus` derive from GitLab's `detailed_merge_status` (`mergeable` → `CLEAN`, `conflict` → `DIRTY`, `need_rebase` → `BEHIND`, `draft_status` → `DRAFT`, still computing → `UNKNOWN`, every other blocker → `BLOCKED`). `files` carries per-file `additions`/`deletions` counted from the MR diffs; `additions` sums them and `changedFiles` counts them. GitLab collapses very large diffs, which then count as zero — when the size matters, fetch the branch with **checkout-pr** and use `git diff --shortstat`. `commits` carries `oid`, `messageHeadline`, and `authoredDate`. `closingIssuesReferences` comes from GitLab's own closes-issues list.

#### list-prs
State (`opened`, `merged`, `closed`, `all`), optional search text and date bound, limit (≤100) → PRs in the **get-pr** shape, without the heavy fields (`reviews`, `latestReviews`, `commits`, `files`, `comments`, and `additions` are empty or null — call **get-pr** for them). GitLab's `closed` state already means closed without merging. Cost: four API calls per MR (the MR, approvals, reviewers, closes-issues), so keep `limit` as small as the caller needs on gitlab.com's rate limits.
```bash
# $1 = state, $2 = limit, $3 = optional updated-after ISO date, $4 = optional search text.
gl_list_prs() {
  local q iids out iid
  q="projects/$(gl_project)/merge_requests?state=$1&order_by=updated_at&sort=desc&per_page=${2:-100}"
  [ -n "${3:-}" ] && q="$q&updated_after=$3"
  [ -n "${4:-}" ] && q="$q&search=$(printf '%s' "$4" | jq -sRr @uri)"
  iids=$(gl_get "$q" -r '.[].iid') || return 1
  out=$(for iid in $iids; do GL_PR_LIGHT=1 gl_pr_json "$iid" || exit 1; done) || return 1
  printf '%s' "$out" | jq -s '.'
}
gl_list_prs opened 100
PRS=$(gl_list_prs merged {limit} "${SINCE_DATE}") || exit 1
printf '%s' "$PRS" | jq --arg d "${SINCE_DATE}" '[.[] | select(.mergedAt >= $d)]'
PRS=$(gl_list_prs closed {limit} "${SINCE_DATE}") || exit 1
printf '%s' "$PRS" | jq --arg d "${SINCE_DATE}" '[.[] | select(.closedAt >= $d)]'
```

#### search-prs
Free-text query and state (`opened`, `merged`, `closed`, `all`) → matching PRs. An issue reference (`#123`) uses GitLab's related-merge-requests list for that issue, which finds MRs that mention or close it; any other query (a plan path, a slug) searches MR titles and descriptions.
```bash
gl_search_prs() {
  local p found
  p=$(gl_project) || return 1
  case "$1" in
    \#*)
      gl_iid "${1#\#}" || return 1
      found=$(gl_list "projects/$p/issues/${1#\#}/related_merge_requests") || return 1
      found=$(printf '%s' "$found" | jq --arg s "$2" '[.[] | select($s == "all" or .state == $s)]') ;;
    *)
      found=$(gl_get "projects/$p/merge_requests?state=$2&in=title,description&search=$(printf '%s' "$1" | jq -sRr @uri)&per_page=100" '.') || return 1 ;;
  esac
  printf '%s' "$found" | jq "$GL_JQ_DEFS"'[.[] | {number: .iid, title, url: .web_url, state: (.state | gl_state)}]'
}
gl_search_prs "#{issueId}" opened
```

#### create-pr
Base branch, draft flag, title, body file → PR. Push the branch first; the source branch is the current one. A draft gets the `Draft:` title prefix.
```bash
PR=$(jq -n --arg s "$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)" --arg b "$BASE_BRANCH" --arg t "<title>" \
  --argjson draft true --rawfile d <body-file> \
  '{source_branch: $s, target_branch: $b, title: (if $draft then "Draft: " + $t else $t end), description: $d, remove_source_branch: false}' \
  | gl_write POST "projects/$(gl_project)/merge_requests")
PR_URL=$(printf '%s' "$PR" | jq -er '.web_url') || exit 1
PR_NUMBER=$(printf '%s' "$PR" | jq -er '.iid') || exit 1
```

#### update-pr
`{prNumber}`, new title and/or body file → the MR's own title/description rewritten in place. Pass only what changed. A title update keeps the `Draft:` prefix while the MR is a draft, so it never promotes the MR as a side effect.
```bash
gl_iid {prNumber} || exit 1
DRAFT=$(gl_get "projects/$(gl_project)/merge_requests/{prNumber}" '.draft // false')
jq -n --arg t "<title>" --argjson draft "$DRAFT" \
  "$GL_JQ_DEFS"'{title: (if $draft and ($t | test(gl_draft_re; "i") | not) then "Draft: " + $t else $t end)}' \
  | gl_write PUT "projects/$(gl_project)/merge_requests/{prNumber}" >/dev/null
jq -n --rawfile d <body-file> '{description: $d}' | gl_write PUT "projects/$(gl_project)/merge_requests/{prNumber}" >/dev/null
```

#### comment-pr
`{prNumber}`, body file → the new note's handle.
```bash
gl_iid {prNumber} || exit 1
gl_note merge_requests {prNumber} <body-file>
```

#### attach-image-evidence
`{prNumber}`, a markdown body file (without the images), a `{slug}` (e.g. `pr-{prNumber}`), and local PNG paths → one note with the images embedded **inline**; returns the note URL.

Commit the images to a dedicated slash-free evidence branch (never the MR's own branch) through the Repository Files API, then reference their `/-/raw/` URLs. On a private or internal project those URLs render for viewers signed in to the instance.
```bash
gl_iid {prNumber} || exit 1
P=$(gl_project)
WEB=$(gl_get "projects/$P" -r '.web_url')
DEFAULT_BRANCH=$(gl_get "projects/$P" -r '.default_branch')
EVIDENCE_BRANCH="qa-evidence-{slug}"
glab api "projects/$P/repository/branches/${EVIDENCE_BRANCH}" >/dev/null 2>&1 ||
  jq -n --arg b "$EVIDENCE_BRANCH" --arg r "$DEFAULT_BRANCH" '{branch: $b, ref: $r}' \
    | gl_write POST "projects/$P/repository/branches" >/dev/null

# Image bytes never touch a command line: base64 goes to a temp file that jq reads.
BODY_IMAGES=""
EV_TMP=$(mktemp)
for img in "<image-path>" "<image-path>"; do   # one quoted argument per image
  name=$(basename "$img")
  path="{slug}/${name}"
  enc_path=$(printf '%s' "$path" | jq -sRr @uri)
  enc_name=$(printf '%s' "$name" | jq -sRr @uri)
  base64 < "$img" | tr -d '\n' > "$EV_TMP"
  jq -n --rawfile c "$EV_TMP" --arg b "$EVIDENCE_BRANCH" --arg m "qa evidence {slug}" \
    '{branch: $b, encoding: "base64", content: $c, commit_message: $m}' > "$EV_TMP.json"
  gl_write POST "projects/$P/repository/files/${enc_path}" < "$EV_TMP.json" >/dev/null 2>&1 ||
    gl_write PUT "projects/$P/repository/files/${enc_path}" < "$EV_TMP.json" >/dev/null
  BODY_IMAGES="${BODY_IMAGES}
![${name}](${WEB}/-/raw/${EVIDENCE_BRANCH}/{slug}/${enc_name})"
done
rm -f "$EV_TMP" "$EV_TMP.json"

{ cat <body-file>; printf '%s\n' "$BODY_IMAGES"; } > "$EV_TMP.body"
NOTE_HANDLE=$(gl_note merge_requests {prNumber} "$EV_TMP.body") || { rm -f "$EV_TMP.body"; exit 1; }
rm -f "$EV_TMP.body"
gl_get "projects/$P/merge_requests/{prNumber}" -r --arg n "${NOTE_HANDLE##*/}" '"\(.web_url)#note_\($n)"'
```
Fallbacks: when the evidence branch cannot be created or written (no Developer access, a protected-branch rule matching `qa-evidence-*`), post the note with the local artifact paths instead and say inline rendering is unavailable. Never store evidence on the MR's own branch, and never force-push.

#### assign-pr / unassign-pr
The same read-modify-write as **assign-issue**, on the merge request: `gl_assign merge_requests {prNumber} add <username>` / `gl_assign merge_requests {prNumber} remove <username>`.

#### label-pr / unlabel-pr
Always through the guards: `apply_label "<label>" {prNumber}` / `set_pipeline_label {prNumber} "<label>"` for the mutually exclusive pipeline group; direct removal: `remove_label "<label>" {prNumber}`.

#### get-pr-diff
`{prNumber}` → the full unified diff, or the changed-file list.
```bash
gl_iid {prNumber} || exit 1
gl_list_jq "projects/$(gl_project)/merge_requests/{prNumber}/diffs" -r '.[] |
  "diff --git a/\(.old_path) b/\(.new_path)\n--- \(if .new_file then "/dev/null" else "a/" + .old_path end)\n+++ \(if .deleted_file then "/dev/null" else "b/" + .new_path end)\n\(.diff)"'
gl_list_jq "projects/$(gl_project)/merge_requests/{prNumber}/diffs" -r '.[].new_path'   # name-only
```
GitLab truncates or collapses very large diffs. When a file's `diff` is empty but the file changed, check out the MR (**checkout-pr**) and use `git diff "origin/<baseRefName>...HEAD"`.

#### get-pr-files
`{prNumber}` → changed files with per-file status.
```bash
gl_iid {prNumber} || exit 1
gl_list_jq "projects/$(gl_project)/merge_requests/{prNumber}/diffs" '[.[] | {path: .new_path,
  status: (if .new_file then "added" elif .deleted_file then "removed" elif .renamed_file then "renamed" else "modified" end)}]'
```

#### checkout-pr
`{prNumber}` → the MR head available locally. GitLab publishes every MR head, fork MRs included, as `refs/merge-requests/<iid>/head` on the target project.
```bash
gl_iid {prNumber} || exit 1
git fetch origin "refs/merge-requests/{prNumber}/head:mr-{prNumber}"
git checkout "mr-{prNumber}"
```
To push fixes to a fork MR, push to the source project's repository URL and `headRefName` — possible only when `maintainerCanModify` is true. For a same-project MR, check out `headRefName` from `origin` instead.

#### review-pr
`{prNumber}`, verdict (approve / request changes), body file. Approving is GitLab's native approval; requesting changes revokes this user's approval, if any. Both then post the review body as a note that opens with the hidden verdict marker (see Conventions), which is how **get-pr** reads the verdict back.
```bash
gl_review() {
  local p me ids marker note_body rc
  gl_iid "$1" || return 1
  p=$(gl_project) || return 1
  # Become a listed reviewer first: get-pr trusts verdict markers only from reviewers/approvers.
  me=$(gl_get user '.id') || return 1
  ids=$(gl_get "projects/$p/merge_requests/$1" -c --argjson u "$me" \
    '[(.reviewers // [])[].id] | if index([$u]) then . else . + [$u] end') || return 1
  jq -n --argjson ids "$ids" '{reviewer_ids: $ids}' | gl_write PUT "projects/$p/merge_requests/$1" >/dev/null || return 1
  case "$2" in
    approve)
      glab api -X POST "projects/$p/merge_requests/$1/approve" >/dev/null || {
        echo "GitLab refused the approval: authors may be barred from approving their own MR, or approval rules exclude this user." >&2
        return 1
      }
      marker='<!-- review: APPROVED -->' ;;
    request-changes)
      glab api -X POST "projects/$p/merge_requests/$1/unapprove" >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
      marker='<!-- review: CHANGES_REQUESTED -->' ;;
    *) echo "Unknown review verdict: $2" >&2; return 1 ;;
  esac
  note_body=$(mktemp) || return 1
  { printf '%s\n\n' "$marker"; cat "$3"; } > "$note_body" || { rm -f "$note_body"; return 1; }
  gl_note merge_requests "$1" "$note_body"
  rc=$?
  rm -f "$note_body"
  return "$rc"
}
gl_review {prNumber} approve <body-file>
gl_review {prNumber} request-changes <body-file>
```
Surface a refused self-approval instead of working around it, exactly as on GitHub.

#### merge-pr
`{prNumber}` and the `headRefOid` the caller's merge gate checked; squash by default. Passing that SHA makes GitLab refuse the merge if a newer commit landed after the gate, so unverified code never merges. Auto-merge (merge once the pipeline succeeds) only when the skill asks for it; delete the source branch only when asked.
```bash
gl_iid {prNumber} || exit 1
jq -n --arg sha "<headRefOid>" '{squash: true, sha: $sha}' \
  | gl_write PUT "projects/$(gl_project)/merge_requests/{prNumber}/merge" | jq -e '.state == "merged"' >/dev/null
jq -n --arg sha "<headRefOid>" '{squash: true, sha: $sha, merge_when_pipeline_succeeds: true}' \
  | gl_write PUT "projects/$(gl_project)/merge_requests/{prNumber}/merge" >/dev/null   # auto-merge
```
A project whose squash setting is "Do not allow" rejects `squash: true`, and a moved head answers 409; surface either rather than merging differently. Recent GitLab versions also accept `auto_merge: true` in place of the older `merge_when_pipeline_succeeds`.

#### mark-pr-ready
Promote a draft MR by stripping the draft prefix from its title, then read it back.
```bash
gl_iid {prNumber} || exit 1
glab api "projects/$(gl_project)/merge_requests/{prNumber}" \
  | jq "$GL_JQ_DEFS"'{title: (.title | sub(gl_draft_re; ""; "i"))}' \
  | gl_write PUT "projects/$(gl_project)/merge_requests/{prNumber}" >/dev/null
gl_get "projects/$(gl_project)/merge_requests/{prNumber}" -e '(.draft // false) == false' >/dev/null
```

#### get-pr-checks
`{prNumber}` → the jobs and downstream-pipeline bridges of the MR's head pipeline, with `name`, `state`, `bucket` (`pass`/`fail`/`pending`/`skipping`/`cancel`, the same buckets `github.md` reports), `link`, and the stage as `workflow`. No head pipeline means no CI ran: an empty list.
```bash
gl_pr_checks() {
  local p head pid pp jobs bridges
  gl_iid "$1" || return 1
  p=$(gl_project) || return 1
  head=$(gl_get "projects/$p/merge_requests/$1" -c '.head_pipeline // {}') || return 1
  pid=$(printf '%s' "$head" | jq -r '.id // empty')
  [ -n "$pid" ] || { echo '[]'; return 0; }
  # A fork MR's pipeline usually runs in the source project: address the pipeline's own project.
  pp=$(printf '%s' "$head" | jq -r '.project_id // empty')
  case "$pp" in ''|*[!0-9]*) pp=$p ;; esac
  jobs=$(gl_list "projects/$pp/pipelines/$pid/jobs") || { echo "Could not read jobs of pipeline $pid" >&2; return 1; }
  bridges=$(gl_list "projects/$pp/pipelines/$pid/bridges" 2>/dev/null) || bridges='[]'
  printf '%s\n%s\n' "$jobs" "$bridges" | jq -s "$GL_JQ_DEFS"'add | map(gl_check)'
}
gl_pr_checks {prNumber}
```
A failed job marked `allow_failure: true` reports `NEUTRAL` (bucket `pass`); a manual job reports `PENDING` only when it blocks the pipeline. A job list that cannot be read is an error, never an empty list — an empty list means "no CI ran", which a merge gate would read as nothing to wait for.

#### get-required-checks
GitLab has no per-branch list of required checks. The merge rule is the project's "Pipelines must succeed" setting, which a failing non-`allow_failure` job violates. This operation therefore prints no check names — the contract's "unreadable" case — and every check **get-pr-checks** reports counts as required. Allow-failure jobs are already `NEUTRAL` there, so they never block. Print the project setting for the record:
```bash
gl_get "projects/$(gl_project)" -r '"only_allow_merge_if_pipeline_succeeds=\(.only_allow_merge_if_pipeline_succeeds)"' >&2
```
External status checks (Ultimate) are not included; a team that uses them extends this operation in its copy.

#### get-pr-comment / get-review-comment
Comment handle → body, author, URL. Conversation notes and inline diff notes share one API on GitLab, so both use `gl_get_comment` from **get-issue-comment**: `gl_get_comment merge_requests/{prNumber}/{noteId}`. A pasted `…/-/merge_requests/<iid>#note_<id>` link maps onto that handle.

#### list-review-comments
`{prNumber}` → every inline diff note on the MR (file, line, author, body), with GitLab's thread `resolved` state — which GitHub's REST API does not expose. `reply_to` is the handle of the first note in the thread for replies, `null` for the note that opened it.
```bash
gl_iid {prNumber} || exit 1
WEB=$(gl_get "projects/$(gl_project)/merge_requests/{prNumber}" -r '.web_url')
gl_list_jq "projects/$(gl_project)/merge_requests/{prNumber}/discussions" \
  --arg k "merge_requests/{prNumber}" --arg w "$WEB" '[.[] | .notes as $ns | $ns[] | select(.type == "DiffNote")
    | {id: "\($k)/\(.id)", user: .author.username, path: (.position.new_path // .position.old_path),
       line: (.position.new_line // .position.old_line), body, url: "\($w)#note_\(.id)",
       reply_to: (if .id == $ns[0].id then null else "\($k)/\($ns[0].id)" end), resolved: (.resolved // false)}]'
```

### CI runs

CI status for an *MR* comes from **get-pr-checks** above. These operations address **pipelines** directly — a GitLab pipeline is a "run" here, and its id is the `{runId}`.

#### list-runs
Branch (or head SHA) → recent pipelines with `databaseId`, `workflowName` (the pipeline source, e.g. `push`, `merge_request_event`), `status` (`queued`/`in_progress`/`completed`), and `conclusion` (`success`/`failure`/`cancelled`/`skipped`/`action_required`).
```bash
gl_get "projects/$(gl_project)/pipelines?ref=$(printf '%s' "{branch}" | jq -sRr @uri)&order_by=id&sort=desc&per_page=20" \
  "$GL_JQ_DEFS"'map(gl_run)'
gl_get "projects/$(gl_project)/pipelines?sha={headSha}&order_by=id&sort=desc&per_page=20" "$GL_JQ_DEFS"'map(gl_run)'
```

#### get-run
Pipeline id → status, conclusion, and per-job breakdown.
```bash
gl_iid {runId} || exit 1
P=$(gl_project)
JOBS=$(mktemp)
gl_list "projects/$P/pipelines/{runId}/jobs" > "$JOBS" || { rm -f "$JOBS"; exit 1; }
gl_get "projects/$P/pipelines/{runId}" --slurpfile jobs "$JOBS" "$GL_JQ_DEFS"'gl_run + {jobs: [$jobs[0][]
  | {databaseId: .id, name, stage, url: .web_url, allowFailure: .allow_failure} + gl_run_status]}'
rm -f "$JOBS"
```

#### get-run-failed-logs
Pipeline id → the trace of each failed job (the last 400 lines of each; failures are at the end). This is the primary diagnosis input for CI failures.
```bash
gl_iid {runId} || exit 1
P=$(gl_project)
FAILED_JOBS=$(gl_list_jq "projects/$P/pipelines/{runId}/jobs?scope=failed" -r '.[] | "\(.id)\t\(.name)\t\(.allow_failure)"') || exit 1
if [ -n "$FAILED_JOBS" ]; then printf '%s\n' "$FAILED_JOBS" | while IFS="$(printf '\t')" read -r job name allowed; do
      printf '=== job %s (#%s, allow_failure=%s) ===\n' "$name" "$job" "$allowed"
      TRACE=$(glab api "projects/$P/jobs/$job/trace") || exit 1
      printf '%s\n' "$TRACE" | tail -n 400
    done
fi
```

#### rerun-failed
Pipeline id → retry only its failed and canceled jobs. Use to disambiguate flaky failures before changing any code.
```bash
gl_iid {runId} || exit 1
RETRY=$(glab api -X POST "projects/$(gl_project)/pipelines/{runId}/retry") || { echo "GitLab refused the retry of pipeline {runId}" >&2; exit 1; }
printf '%s' "$RETRY" | jq "$GL_JQ_DEFS"'gl_run'
```

#### watch-run
Pipeline id → block until the pipeline finishes; exit non-zero unless it succeeded. `glab` has no blocking watch for an arbitrary pipeline, so this polls **get-run** within the caller's wait budget (`ci.maxWaitMinutes`, default 40).
```bash
gl_iid {runId} || exit 1
DEADLINE=$(( $(date +%s) + ${CI_MAX_WAIT_MINUTES:-40} * 60 ))
while :; do
  # A failed poll is retried until the deadline, never read as a finished pipeline.
  RUN=$(gl_get "projects/$(gl_project)/pipelines/{runId}" -c "$GL_JQ_DEFS"'gl_run') || RUN='{}'
  [ "$(printf '%s' "$RUN" | jq -r '.status // empty')" = completed ] && break
  [ "$(date +%s)" -ge "$DEADLINE" ] && { echo "Pipeline {runId} still running after the wait budget" >&2; exit 2; }
  sleep 30
done
printf '%s' "$RUN" | jq -e '.conclusion == "success"' >/dev/null
```

### Labels

#### list-labels
→ every label name available to the project, including labels inherited from its groups.
```bash
gl_list_jq "projects/$(gl_project)/labels" -r '.[].name'
```

#### create-label
Name, color (`#rrggbb`), description. Creates a project label; teams that share a taxonomy across projects may create the same names as group labels instead. Never delete, rename, or recolor existing labels.
```bash
gl_create_label() {
  jq -n --arg n "$1" --arg c "$2" --arg d "$3" '{name: $n, color: $c, description: $d}' \
    | gl_write POST "projects/$(gl_project)/labels" >/dev/null
}
gl_create_label "<name>" "#<hex>" "<description>"
```

#### ensure-label-taxonomy
Create every label from the config's taxonomy that does not exist yet (used by `om-setup-agent-pipeline`; skips ones **list-labels** already returns):
```bash
EXISTING=$(gl_list "projects/$(gl_project)/labels") || { echo "Could not read GitLab labels" >&2; exit 1; }
EXISTING=$(printf '%s' "$EXISTING" | jq -r '.[].name')
while IFS='|' read -r name color description; do
  [ -n "$name" ] || continue
  printf '%s\n' "$EXISTING" | grep -Fxq "$name" || gl_create_label "$name" "$color" "$description"
